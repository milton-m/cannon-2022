# About
Personal project from 2022; a physics simulator of a cannon shooting cannonballs. The cannonballs undergo projectile motion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion). 
The main program is "Kanon.py", with "Kulkast.py" being a test program for canonball.

## Controls
Aim with mouse and shoot single ball with right click, or hold space for fully automatic shooting.
